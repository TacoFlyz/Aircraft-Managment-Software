Hello everyone and thanks for checking out this page!
Here we will be posting stuff about what we are doing.
The project is currently a software to manage an commercial airplane.
We are creating a software to run on Crew Service Panels that you can find in the galley of an airplane.
Things that we put on there is a PA system managment and some music controls and also lighting controls and also we will have some controls for the seatbekt signs.
This project development is under way.
We will create a working demo online and we will post our code here.
The code licesning is still being determined and the software may be for sale when we do testing with realill be de aircraft.
This project's estimated timeline is 1 year. We should be completed with this project in March of 2023.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and changing aircraft technology and new hardware, there will be delays, so the estimated timeline may be extended.\
The software will be in the form of an android app, which will require us to install android onto the aircraft and the app is under development. Timeline has been exteneded to 2 years
