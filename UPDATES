The timeline after putting in all the factors for this to be aircraft ready, the new timelien has been changed to 5 years. 
Depends on the rate of development the max timeline estimated is 10 years, but chances are it will be less then that. We are not sure.
Development with android studio has not started just yet.
Android studio development should start soon. After we finish developing the app there is more.
We will need to make a system to connect the application to the actual aircraft which will require a long process.
We will need to find someone to let us use an aircraft for software research purposes.
The software will be open source and there will be a testing program in place.
For now we will work on the app itself and more updates are coming soon.

We have changed the software to an andriod app and the timeline has been extended to 2 years.
We will be using Android studio to create this app and in the next few weeks we will be putting progress reports on the updates page.
The final code will be avalible on GitHub after we handle the testing of the code on real aircraft as we will need to install andriod onto the aircraft.
With this the timeline will be around 2 years but longer because of actually making it ready for aircraft. We will also need to make a new hardware controlling
system.
